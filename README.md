# 🤓📚 λ-Geeks' Time 📚🤓

*A weekly paper discussion forum for LiDAR, Remote Sensing, and Multimodal Sensing Research*  

Welcome to **λ-Geeks' Time**! This repository hosts the materials and logistics for our weekly group paper discussions. The symbol **λ** (lambda)—representing *spectrum*—reflects the wide range of interconnected topics we explore: from **LiDAR** and **multispectral imaging** to **advanced AI techniques** and **geospatial analysis**.

Each week, we come together to dive into a research paper related to above topics. These sessions help us sharpen our understanding of cutting-edge work and explore its relevance to our own research.

Our Goals:

* **Stay sharp and curious** – Track breakthroughs in LiDAR, AI, and sensing systems to stay on the cutting edge.
* **Build collective insight** – Share perspectives and strategies to accelerate understanding and problem-solving.
* **Explore with purpose** – Connect research to real-world applications and our own projects.

Whether you're an undergraduate, graduate student, or postdoc, you're warmly welcome here. Bring your curiosity, your questions, and your own paper suggestions! While we encourage regular participation, feel free to join whenever a topic sparks your interest.

Let’s challenge ourselves, expand our vision, and grow—together.





## How to Take Part

- Step 1: Check Out the Paper Proposal  
Three paper options will be shared the week before via email.

- Step 2: Vote for the Paper(s) to Discuss [**Here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qtEVUmaqrHbyZwN6tZVJzuS0EeOU4mtVxyJrCBGTMvU/edit?tab=t.mds9qz7e29is)
  - Click the **week number** to view the paper list, then hit the **thumbs-up icon** below your preferred choice(s).
  - Don’t forget to **sign up in the table** below if you haven't yet.
  - Voting deadline: **Mondays at 5:00 PM**

- Step 3: Read the Paper Ahead  
The chosen paper (based on voting) will be shared via email every Monday night. Please read it ahead—whether just skimming or diving in thoroughly. Give it at least as much time as a medium Starbucks coffee ☕ — it’ll help make our discussion more engaging.
- Step 4: Join the Discussion - **Fridays, 3:00 - 4:00 PM**.
