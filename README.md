# λ-Geeks' Time

*A weekly paper discussion forum for LiDAR, Remote Sensing, and Multimodal Sensing Research*

Welcome to **λ-Geeks' Time**! This repository hosts materials and logistics for our weekly group paper discussions. The symbol **λ (lambda)** stands for *spectrum*, reflecting the broad yet interconnected themes we explore—from LiDAR and multispectral imaging to advanced AI techniques and geospatial analysis.


## 📚 Weekly Paper Discussion
Every week, we gather to discuss a paper related to LiDAR, remote sensing, or multimodal sensing. The goal is to deepen our understanding of the latest research and its implications for our work. We aim to use these discussions to:

* **Learn with ambition**: Stay on top of the latest breakthroughs in LiDAR, remote sensing, and AI.
* **Learn efficiently**: Share insights, save time, grow together.
* **Learn with fun**: Turn paper reading into an engaging, idea-filled group adventure.
