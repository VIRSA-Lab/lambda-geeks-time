# λ-Geeks' Time

*A weekly paper discussion forum for LiDAR, Remote Sensing, and Multimodal Sensing Research*

Welcome to **λ-Geeks' Time**! This repository hosts materials and logistics for our weekly group paper discussions. The symbol **λ (lambda)** stands for *spectrum*, reflecting the broad yet interconnected themes we explore—from LiDAR and multispectral imaging to advanced AI techniques and geospatial analysis.
