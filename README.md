# λ-Geeks' Time

*A weekly paper discussion forum for LiDAR, Remote Sensing, and Multimodal Sensing Research*

Welcome to **λ-Geeks' Time**! This repository hosts materials and logistics for our weekly group paper discussions. The symbol **λ (lambda)** stands for *spectrum*, reflecting the broad yet interconnected themes we explore—from LiDAR and multispectral imaging to advanced AI techniques and geospatial analysis.

## Weekly Paper Discussion

Each week, we come together to discuss a paper related to LiDAR, remote sensing, or multimodal sensing. These sessions are designed to deepen our understanding of cutting-edge research and explore how it connects to our own work.

Our goals are to:

* **Learn with ambition**: Stay informed on the latest breakthroughs in LiDAR, remote sensing, and AI
* **Learn efficiently**: Share insights, save time, and grow together
* **Learn with fun**: Make paper reading a lively, idea-driven group experience
